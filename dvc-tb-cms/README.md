## Create database

The first thing to do is to create a database:

```sh
$ docker run --name dvctb-postgre -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dvctb -e POSTGRES_USER=dvctb -e POSTGRES_DB=dvctb -d postgres:14
```

Next, clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/EkilaVN/dvc-tb.git
$ cd dvc-tb-cms
```

Then install the dependencies (use Node >= 20):

```sh

Remove `.example` in `.env.example` and update the values for the environment variables.
